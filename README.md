# Data Analytics in R

## Activity, Language, Use and Social Interactions in an Online Community (online_forum_analysis.pdf)
In this report, I made valuable conclusions about the activity, language and social networks formed in an online forum. I did this by cleaning and manipulating a large, dirty, data set containing all the posts on an online forum. I extract useful information like the thread ID, author ID, word count and proportion of language variables from each post and use statistical techniques such as t-tests and hypothesis testing for comparisons. I explored data visualisation tools such as time series, histograms, heat maps, correlation matrices, bar graphs, line graphs and histograms to aid my analysis. Finally, I used graphs and its properties (such as closeness centrality, betweeness centrality, degree of vertices and eigenvalues) to analyse the social networks formed in the online forum. The R code is included in the appendix.

In this report, I explored and made comparisons between a variety of classification models such as Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Bagging and Boosting to predict the probability of rain in 10 different locations in Australia, using dataset taken from Kaggle.
